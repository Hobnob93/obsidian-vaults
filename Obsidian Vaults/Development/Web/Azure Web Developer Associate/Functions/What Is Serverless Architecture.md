Generally refers to fully managed cloud services.
Some services are more serverless than others.
Classification of a cloud service being serverless is not a yes-no answer, but rather a scale.

Look at the following characteristics:
- Highly elastic and scalable
- Highly available
- Highly durable
- Secure by default

It abstracts underlying infrastructure.
Billed based on execution of business task (so not billed based on hardware).
Serverless can scale to zero when not in use, so no running costs.
- __Pay-for-Value__ - you do not pay for idle servers
