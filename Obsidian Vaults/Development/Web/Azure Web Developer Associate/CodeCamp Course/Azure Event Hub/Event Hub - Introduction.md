Azure Event Hub is an event ingestor.
It can consume millions of events from anywhere.
It can process these in real-time or via micro-batching.
There is an auto-inflate feature, automatically scaling the throughput to meet any changing needs.

Event Hub provides an easy way to connect with your Apache Kafka applications and clients.
