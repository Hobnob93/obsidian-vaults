Redis is an open-source in-memory database store.
Redis acts as a caching layer, or a very fast database.
Since all data is in memory, it's highly volatile so data loss is possible.

Redis is very fast - it can deliver content from its store with single to double-digit milliseconds.

Redis is a key-value store, and it supports the following data types:
- [[Azure Cache - Redis Strings|String]]
- [[Azure Cache - Redis Sets#Unordered Sets|Set]]
- [[Azure Cache - Redis Sets#Ordered Sets|Sorted Set]]
- [[Azure Cache - Redis Lists|List]]
- [[Azure Cache - Redis Hashes|Hash]]
- Bitmap
- Bitfield
- HyperLog
- Geospatial Index
- Stream
