Azure Front Door is capable of traffic acceleration (also called global acceleration).
Without requiring to make any modifications to app code, this can speed up global delivery of your application.

Azure achieves this by directing traffic to nearest edge location.
Think of an edge location as a sort of "on ramp" into the Azure Network.

Traffic that is flowing within the Azure Network travels at accelerated speed while also taking the most direct path.
Think of it as a sort of "expressway".
