Endpoint Manager provides an overview of endpoints you've configured for your Azure Front Door.
Not to be confused with Microsoft Endpoint Manager, of which this bears no relation.

The endpoint is sort of more of an entry point, ending with a custom domain (or the provided azurefd.net if a custom one isn't used).

For each endpoint it will show:
- Domains
- Origin groups
- Routes
- Security / WAF

Endpoint Manager lists how many instances of each element are created within an endpoint.
The association status for each element will also be displayed.
