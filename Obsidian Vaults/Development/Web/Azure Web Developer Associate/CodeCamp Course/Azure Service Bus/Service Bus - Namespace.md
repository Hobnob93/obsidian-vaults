A namespace is a container for all messaging components (queues and topics).
A single namespace can contain multiple queues and topics.
Namespaces are often used as *application containers*.

A Service Bus namespace is a capacity slice of a large cluster made up of active virtual machines that you control.
May optionally span 3 Azure Availability zones.
You get all benefits of running the message broker at massive scale, in terms of robustness and availability.

Service Bus is serverless messaging so you don't need to worry about underlying complexities.
