There are some key concepts to do with Service Buses:
- **Namespace**
	- works like a server
	- has `N` queues and topics
	- see [[Service Bus - Namespace]]
- **Queue**
	- contains the messages
	- see [[Service Bus - Queues]]
- **Sender**
	- sends the messages
- **Receiver**
	- receives the messages
- **Topic**
	- a queue with multiple receivers that works like a queue
	- see [[Service Bus - Topics]]
- **Subscription**
	- a receiver in a topic
- **Batch**
	- group of messages
- **Safe-batch**
	- validates if each message can be included in the batch
- **Session**
	- allows you to use FIFO
	- groups your messages in a queue
- **Peek**
	- retrieves a message in the queue without removing it
- **Dead-letter Queue**
	- a queue for messages unable to be delivered through normal queue
- **Peek & Lock**
	- retrieves a message from the queue without removing it
	- locks the message so other receivers cannot receive it
- **Receive & Delete**
	- retrieves a message from the queue
	- deletes that message
- **Auto Delete on Idle**
	- sets a timespan to delete the queue if it is not used
- **Duplicate Detection History**
	- checks if message was sent earlier before sending a message
