Microsoft Graph connectors offer a simple way to bring external data into Microsoft Graph.
It can enhance Microsoft 365 intelligence experiences.
You might want to build a custom connector to integrate with services that aren't available as connectors built by Microsoft using the Microsoft Graph connector REST APIs.

You can use MS Graph connectors API to:
- Create and manage external data connections
- Define and register schema of the external data type(s)
- Ingest external data items into MS Graph.
- Sync external groups.

**Microsoft Search** indexes all your MS 365 data to make it searchable for users.
With MS Graph connectors, your organisation can index third-party so it *appears* in **Microsoft Search** results.

Microsoft has a [gallery website](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-search/connectors) containing 100+ connectors.
Connectors are implemented by Microsoft or third-party partners.
