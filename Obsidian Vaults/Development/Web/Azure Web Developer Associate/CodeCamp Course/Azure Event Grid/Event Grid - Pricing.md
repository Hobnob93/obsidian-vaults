There is just the basic tier for Event Grid.
You get 100,000 operations for free per month.
- An operation is a publish event or a delivery attempt
Beyond that, you're charged $0.60 per million operations.

There is a preview version of Event Grid on Kubernetes with Azure Arc.
This is free during the preview period.
Still have to pay for underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.
