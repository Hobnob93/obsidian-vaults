Developer Portal is an automatically generated, fully customisable website with the documentation of your APIs.
It is where API consumers can discover your APIs.
They can learn how to use them, request access, and try them out.

You need to publish for the portal to be publicly viewable.
You can save revisions of the portal, to quickly rollback to previous versions.
You can apply a custom domain for your developer portal.

This feature is only available for the Premium, Standard, Basic, and Developer tiers of APIM.
