#### Frontends
Frontends define the route/endpoint.
They have the documentation and configuration around that endpoint.

APIM does *not* host APIs, it creates a fa√ßade for your APIs.

You may have the frontend `POST /resource` which has the valid responses of `200 OK`.
Then within the documentation and configuration for this frontend you can set:
- Display name e.g. `Create resource`
- Name e.g. `create-resource`
- URL e.g. `POST /resource`
- Description
- Tags
