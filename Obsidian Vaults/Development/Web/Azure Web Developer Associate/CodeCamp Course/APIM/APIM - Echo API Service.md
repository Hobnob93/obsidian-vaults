When you create an APIM Gateway, by default you will create an API called Echo API.
It's a dummy API with which to test your APIM against.
Available at http://echoapi.cloudapp.net/api.

Each API is a non-production Azure service.
It us used to test Azure API Management.
You can delete it if you don't need it.
