When you create a Cosmos DB account, it will be made up by a few core components.

##### Database
- Each Azure Cosmos DB account supports multiple, independently named, databases
- A database is a logical namespace for collections, users, and permissions

##### Container
- Created when you create the database
- A unit of compute

##### Collection
- Maps to a container in Azure Cosmos DB
- It is a billable entity, where cost is determined by the provisioned throughput expressed in request units per second
