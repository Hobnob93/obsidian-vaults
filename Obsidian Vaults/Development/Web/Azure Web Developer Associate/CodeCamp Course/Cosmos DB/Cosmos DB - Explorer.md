Cosmos DB Explorer is a web interface to explore and interact with your Cosmos DB accounts.
Available at [cosmos.azure.com](https://cosmos.azure.com).
You can also access it from Azure Portal while inside of your Azure Cosmos DB account resource - simply click `Data Explorer` in the left hand column.

Removes the hassle of having to connect to an API manually and gives you a visual interface from which to interact with your databases.
Sort of functions like SSMS.
The GUI will adapt depending on the type of database that is being accessed.
