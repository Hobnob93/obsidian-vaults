A runtime software/instructions that are executed while your program is running.
A runtime generally means what programming language, libraries and framework you are using.

A runtime for Azure App Services will be a pre-defined container that has your programming language and commonly used library for that language installed.

With Azure App Services you choose a runtime:
- .NET
- .NET Core
- Java
- Ruby
- Node.js
- PHP
- Python

Azure App Services will have generally multiple latest versions of a programming language.
It's common for a cloud provider to stop supporting older versions so you keep up to date, and forces customers to keep good security practises by having latest patches.
