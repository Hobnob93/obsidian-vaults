External Identities in Azure AD allow people outside your organisation to access your apps and resources.
It lets them sign in using whatever identity they prefer.
Your partners, distributors, vendors, and other guest users can "bring their own identities".
Examples would be **Google** and **Facebook**.

Share apps with external users (B2B collaboration).
Develop apps intended for other Azure AD tenants (single-tenant or multi-tenant)
Develop white-labelled apps for consumers and customers (Azure AD B2C)
