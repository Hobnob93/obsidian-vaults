#azure #az-204 

Microsoft introduced Active Directory Domain Services in Windows 2000.
It gave organisations the ability to manage multiple on-premises infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user.

Azure AD takes this approach further.
It provides organisations with an **Identity as a Service (IDaaS)** solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises.

Both these versions are still used today:
- Active Directory - for on-premise
- Azure AD - for the cloud
