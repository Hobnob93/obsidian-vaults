There are 4 different ways to assign resource access rights to your users:
1. **Direct assignment**
	- Resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource
2. **Group assignment**
	- Resource owner assigns group to the resource
	- All those in the group are given access to the resource
3. **Rule-based assignment**
	- Resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users within that group are assigned to a specific resource
4. **External authority assignment**
	- Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premise directory or a SaaS app.
