Azure Cosmos DB is a service for fully-managed NoSQL databases.
These are designed to scale and have high performance.

Cosmos DB supports different kinds of NoSQL database engines which you interact with via an API:
- Core SQL (document datastore)
- Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB (document datastore)
- Azure Table (key/value datastore)
- Gremlin (graph datastore)
	- Based on Apache TinkerTop

All of these NoSQL engines have a capacity mode:
- Provisioned throughput (pay for guarantee of capacity)
- Serverless (pay for what you use)

**Cosmos DB Explorer** is a web interface to explore and interact with your Cosmos DB accounts.
