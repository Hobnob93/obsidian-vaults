An application runtime is a compute environment configured with necessary software and system config to run a specific type of application code.

Azure provides multiple app runtimes for popular programming languages, called a *Runtime stack*.

Can implement your own *custom handler* for unsupported languages, such as Rust, GO, or Ruby.
