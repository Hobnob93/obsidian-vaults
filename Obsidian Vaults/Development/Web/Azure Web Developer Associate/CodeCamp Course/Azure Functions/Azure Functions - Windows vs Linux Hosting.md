Generally, should use Windows as Microsoft's ecosystem is built around that.
However, you can choose either Windows or Linux when creating an Azure Function App.

An operating system affects:
- Performance
- Limitations of functionality
- Available features

For example, cannot edit function for Linux within Azure Portal once it has been deployed.

Can determine exact OS being used by going to *Docker Hub repository* for the Azure Functions and your runtime.
