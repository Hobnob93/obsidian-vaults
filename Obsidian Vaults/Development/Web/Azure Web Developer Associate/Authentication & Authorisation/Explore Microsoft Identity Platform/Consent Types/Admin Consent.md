# Admin Consent
Required when app needs access to certain high-privilege permissions.
Ensures admins have additional controls before authorising apps or users to high-privilege data.

Consent done on behalf of organisation still requires static permissions registered for the app.
Set permissions for apps in app registration portal if you need admin to give consent on behalf of entire org.
Reduces the cycles required by org admin to set up application.
