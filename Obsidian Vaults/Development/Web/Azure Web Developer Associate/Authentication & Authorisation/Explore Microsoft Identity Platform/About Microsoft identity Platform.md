# About Microsoft identity Platform
Helps you build apps where users and customers can sign in.
Can use Microsoft identities or social accounts.
Can provide authorised access to APIs.

Several components make up Microsoft identity platform:
- **OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect Standard-compliant authentication service**
	- enables devs to authenticate several identity types, including:
		- Work or school accounts, provisioned through *Azure Active Directory*
		- Personal Microsoft account, like *Skype*, *Xbox*, and *Outlook.com*
		- Social or local accounts, using *Azure Directory B2C*
- **Open-source libraries**
	- Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL)
	- support for other standards-compliant libraries
- **Application management portal**
	- registration and configuration experience in *Azure Portal*
	- along with other *Azure* management capabilities
- **Application configuration API and PowerShell**
	- Programmatic config of apps through Microsoft Graph API and PowerShell so you can automate DevOps tasks

For devs, the platform offers integration of modern innovations in identity and security space:
- Passwordless authentication
- Step-up authentication
- Conditional Access
Don't need to implement functionality yourself; apps integrated with platform natively take advantage of such innovations
