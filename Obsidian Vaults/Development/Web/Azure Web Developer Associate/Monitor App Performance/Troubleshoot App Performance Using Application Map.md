Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots.
Can do so across all components of a distributed app,
Each node on map represents an app component or a dependency.
Has health KPI alert status.
Can see more detailed diagnostics, such as App Insights events.
If app uses Azure Services, can click through to Azure diagnostics, such as SQL Database Advisor recommendations.

Components are independently deployable parts of distributed/microservices app.
Devs and ops teams have code-level visibility or access to telemetry generated by these app components.
- Components are different from "observed" external dependencies such as SQL, Event Hubs, etc. which team may not have access to
- Components run on any number of server/role/container instances
- Components can be separate App Insights instrumentation keys or different roles reporting to a single App Insights instrumentation key
- Preview Map experience shows components regardless of how they are set up

Can see full app topology across multiple levels of related app components.
Components could be different App Insights resources, or different roles in a single resource.
App map finds components by following HTTP dependency calls made between servers with App Insights SDK installed.

Experience starts with progressive discovery of components.
When first loading the application map, a set of queries is triggered to discover the components related to this component.
Button in top-left corner will update number of components in your app as they are discovered.

Clicking "Update map components", map is refreshed with all components discovered until that point.
Depending on complexity of app, this may take a while to load.

If all components are roles within a single App Insights resource, discovery step is not required.
Initial load for such an app will have all its components.

A key objective with experience to to be able to visualise complex topologies with hundreds of components.
See related insights and go to performance and failure triage for that component.

Application Map uses cloud role name property to identity components on the map.
You can manually set or override cloud role name and change what gets displayed on the Application Map.
