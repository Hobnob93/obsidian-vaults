A rogue-like "brick-breaker" game themed around the body's immune system.

A "turn" is every time the ball bounces, and player *can* do the following:
- Release a new "ball" from a selection
- Activate individual "ball" abilities

The "balls" are either Helper T cells, Dendritic cells, or phagocytes.
- Dendritic cells identify a pathogen when it passes near or hits them
	- A direct hit adds more to the "knowledge" then just passing nearby does
	- Once "knowledge" is complete on a disease, it unlocks the T Cell for it
	- If a dendritic cell is lost, player immediately gets a new one but all "knowledge" it had is lost
- Helper T Cells are of a particular pathogen type
	- If a T Cell is lost, it will be replenished after x amount of turns
- Phagocytes instant kill any pathogen it hits
	- If they are lost, it is permanently so

The "bricks" are B Cells.
- When destroyed, it releases antibodies for the type of disease the T cell targets.
- Has a chance to release complements

Antibodies track down nearby pathogens.
- On contact with a pathogen, it slows them down
- Can also inflict tiny damage on impact (on upgrade maybe?)
- Killed pathogens may drop complements

Complements (which are just proteins) are collectible "currency".

Pathogens ("the maker of suffering"):
- Bacteria
- Virus
- Fungi
- Protozoa
- Parasite

Other dangers:
- Cancer
- Allergies
- Autoimmune
- Cytokine Storm

Defenses:
- Defensins on skin
- Sweat salt
- Skin
- Acid mantle
- Differing pH levels
- Complements (proteins)
- Friendly bacteria
- Sentinel cells (macrophages) - can reach out like an octopus
- Neutrophils (don't live long) - throw acid or self destruct and can harm friendly cells
- Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET)
- Platelets
- Inflammation
- Dendritic cell (messenger and intelligence officer)
- Phagocytes ("eating cells") - includes macrophages and neutrophils
- Apoptosis - controlled suicide
- Mast cell - causes rapid local inflammation
- Cytokines - small proteins used to convey information
- Toll-like receptors
- Microbial pattern recognition
- Opsonisation
