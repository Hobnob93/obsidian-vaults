A rogue-like "brick-breaker" game themed around the body's immune system.
A "turn" is every time the ball bounces.
The "ball" are Helper T Cells.
The "bricks" are B Cells.
When a B Cell is destroyed, it releases antibodies.
Antibodies track down nearby pathogens to slow them down.
Complements (which are just proteins) are collectible "currency".

Pathogens ("the maker of suffering"):
- Bacteria
- Virus
- Fungi
- Protozoa
- Parasite

Other dangers:
- Cancer
- Allergies
- Autoimmune
- Cytokine Storm

Defenses:
- Defensins on skin
- Sweat salt
- Skin
- Acid mantle
- Differing pH levels
- Complements (proteins)
- Friendly bacteria
- Sentinel cells (macrophages) - can reach out like an octopus
- Neutrophils (don't live long) - throw acid or self destruct and can harm friendly cells
- Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET)
- Platelets
- Inflammation
- Dendritic cell (messenger and intelligence officer)
- Phagocytes ("eating cells") - includes macrophages and neutrophils
- Apoptosis - controlled suicide
- Mast cell - causes rapid local inflammation
- Cytokines - small proteins used to convey information
