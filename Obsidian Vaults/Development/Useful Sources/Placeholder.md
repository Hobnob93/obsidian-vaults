# Placeholder
A useful service for placing in placeholder images when working out a layout or in place of an image you don't have yet.

Can specify the size of the placeholder image, e.g. 150:
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">

Can also use an image containing text that you define in the URL params:
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/728x90.png?text=This+is+just+like+magic!">
