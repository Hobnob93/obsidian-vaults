Browsers come with a few font "stacks".
An example font stack: `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`.
What it means is the browser will first look for `Arial` support; then `Helvetica`, and any `sans-serif` font will become the fallback.

Can use [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com) if you want to use a font not typically supported by browsers.

Can set the font stack in CSS using the `font-family` property.
Can set the font size using the `font-size` property.
Can adjust line height using `line-height` - uses relative units.
- Recommended is `1.6em`.
