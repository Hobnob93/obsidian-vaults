# Measurement Units
There are many different unit types within CSS. It is worth noting that some units can only be used on text, while others cannot be used on text.

- `px`: specific amount defined by the number of pixels
- `%`: percentage of the amount of bounding space of the space it can fill
- `vh`: percentage of the total viewport height
- `vw`: percentage of the total viewport width
