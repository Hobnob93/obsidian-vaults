# Measurement Units
There are many different unit types within CSS. It is worth noting that some units can only be used on text, while others cannot be used on text.

## Absolute Units
- `px`: pixels (`1px = 1/96 inch`)
- `cm`: centimetres
- `mm`: millimetres
- `in`: inches
- `pt`: points (`1pt = 1/72 inch`)
- `pc`: picas (`1pc = 12pt`)

Most of these are not used, with `px` being the most common by far.

## Relative Units
- `%`: percentage of the amount of bounding space of the space it can fill
- `em`: relative to size of parent element (multiplier)
- `rem`: relative to size of root element (multiplier)
- `vh`: percentage of the total viewport height
- `vw`: percentage of the total viewport width
