# Entities
There are many different "entities" that are used within HTML. These are essentially characters in which you otherwise cannot access due to HTML rendering restrictions.

The list of available entities is below:
- `&nbsp;`
  A non-breaking space
  If you want to have multiple space characters in a row, you'll need to use this or the multiple spaces will not render on the web page
- `&gt;`
  A greater-than sign (>)
  You can use the sign directly, but some browsers may think it forms part of an element and may not render correctly as a result
- `&lt;`
  A less-than sign (<)

- `&reg;`

- `&cent;`
