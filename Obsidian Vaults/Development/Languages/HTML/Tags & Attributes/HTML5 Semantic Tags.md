# HTML5 Semantic Tags
Before HTML5, websites were made with most elements being put into a `div` (see [[Div & Section]]).

There have been new tags added in HTML5 to improve this for better organisation, as well as for better accessibility support when it comes to those impaired. Using these new semantics helps makes the web more accessible for everyone.

## Header Tag
Uses the `<header></header>` html tag.

Contains elements that belong at the top of the web page.

May contain the [[#Nav Tag|navigation]], or perhaps a search box or other core elements of the site.

## Footer Tag
Uses the `<footer></footer>` html tag.

Contains elements that belong at the bottom of the web page.

## Nav Tag
Uses the `<nav></nav>` html tag.

Generally towards the top or on the side (using [[#Aside Tag|aside]]) of the web page.

Contains the [[Lists|List]] making up the navigation options.

## Main Tag
Uses the `<main></main>` html tag.

Contains the bulk of the content making up the web page.

## Section Tag
Uses the `<section></section>` html tag.

Serves a similar purpose the `div` tags, and contain the smaller parts of the web page.

## Article Tag
Uses the `article></article>` html tag.

Naturally, this is used for news articles, a blog article, or other forms of written media.

Can also be used for if there are smaller "call to action" cards containing details of an article or blog of sorts. Instead of wrapping this content in a `div`, consider instead using an `article`.

## Aside Tag
Uses the `article></article>` html tag.

Contains sidebar content, such as navbar, related pages, adverts, etc.
