# Images
In modern sites, they tend to be contained within the `wwwroot/img` or `wwwroot/images` folder.

Can link to both internal and external images, just as you would with anchors.

You define an image with the image tag `<img/>`. You can supply the following attributes:
- `src` - the location of the image you want to share - can be internal or external
- `alt` - the text that should be displayed while the image is being fetched or if it is non-existent.

See [[Unsplash]] and [[Placeholder]] as useful image services.
