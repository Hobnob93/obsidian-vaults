## Headings
```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

Try to ensure only *one* `<h1>` per page, and keep the important data in there, as search engines use them to draw information.

## Paragraph
- `<p></p>`
  Contains a block of text.
- `<strong></strong>`
  Makes text within a `p` tag bold by default (as per CSS styling).
- `<em></em>`
  Makes text emphasised (italic) by default, depending on styling settings.
- `<br/>`
  Adds a line break / new paragraph.
  Each `p` tag is its own paragraph in its own right.
- `<hr/>`
  A horizontal rule which adds a line break as before, but fills the whitespace with a visible line which can be styled.
- `<del></del>`
  By default will add a ~~strikethrough~~ on the text.

## Deprecated Tags
A few pre-HTML5 tags have been deprecated and should no longer be used (although they will still work if used). They have been deprecated due to HTML not being meant for styling.
- `<b></b>` - bold
- `<i></i>` - italic
- `<u></u>` - underline
- `<s></s>` - strikethrough
