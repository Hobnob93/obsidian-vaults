# Forms & Input
## Form
Use the `<form></form>` tag to declare a form which will contain various [[#Input Controls]].
- `action` attribute determines where the form contents get submitted to, such as PHP or an MVC Controller action

## Label Tag
You can use a `<label></label>` tag within the `form` for each of the controls. The inner HTML will be the text that is displayed as the label.
- `for` attribute - should match the ID of the control the label is for. Doing this has validation and user experience benefits, such as clicking on the label will select the input control for the user.

## Form Controls
There are many different controls and sub-types of those controls within HTML.

[[Standard Input]]
[[Text Area Input]]
[[Select Field]]
[[Radio Buttons]]
[[Checkbox]]
[[Submit Button]]
[[Reset Button]]
